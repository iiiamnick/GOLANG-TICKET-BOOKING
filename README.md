# GOLANG-TICKET-BOOKING

    A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** ticket booking application written in Go.  
    This project demonstrates the basics of Go programming — variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and concurrency — through a fun, interactive ticket booking example.

---

##  Features

    * Book tickets for an event through the terminal
    * Input validation for name, email, and ticket count
    * Real-time tracking of remaining tickets
    * Concurrency using Go routines to simulate asynchronous booking confirmation
    * Simple and beginner-friendly Go code structure
